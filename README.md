Malware Database that I put malware into. NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES!
Any work outside of the "My-Viruses" folder belongs to their original owner. Inside the "My-Viruses" Everything DOES belong to a license. 
Again, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, AND YOU SHOULD RUN THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK. ALWAYS USE A VIRTUAL MACHINE FIRST. Even if they dont seem harmful, they can be. Always Use a Virtual Machine.
These are only Windows & DOS samples as of the moment, and not Mac or Linux samples. These samples are only for YOUR virtual machine, and you should not by any circumstance use these to "prank" your friends. "Pranking" your friends by downloading these samples and using them to harm your friend's and/or their devices is AGAINST THE LAW and can land you a HEFTY SENTENCE IN COURT.
Again, do not by any means use these outside of a virtual machine whether its by accident or not.

I think I should note that despite probably everyone noticing, if you didn't notice (how????), any file named README.MD (including this one) is not a malware sample and you shouldn't be afraid of it as it won't harm you. Thanks!

Virtual Machines you can use:

VMWare (I use),
Virtualbox (I use),
Hypervisor,
Any.Run (website),
Parallels,
and Microsoft Azure

The password for all zip files is "1337" without the quotation marks. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Tip: If your running ransomware, NEVER USE SHARED FOLDERS!
All viruses belong to their original owners.
I feel like most people don't like malware only because it could harm their computer, but I view it a different way.
Malware isnt always bad, as long as you know what your doing, have the correct programs, and take proper precautions, malware can be fun to experiment with!

Where my samples come from:

90% From Browsing the Internet and downloading every suspicious file I could find

6% From other repositorys (such as: Endermanch'es MalwareDatabase, and NTFS123's MalwareDatabase.)

3% From any.run (it lets you download samples and they are GOOD!)

1% Other sources (ex: archive.org)

## FAQ:
Q: Can I add my own samples?

A: Yes, here's how you can help add a sample and contribute to my repository: Open an Issue in the "Issues" tab and title it something along the lines of "Malware Submission." Once you titled it, in your description, provide a link to the malware you want to add (must be a Wayback Machine download or GitHub link) and tell me the name and type. The way you can see available types is looking at the folders I have at the moment for this repository which means Adware, Antivirus-Rogues, Browsers, Desktop Buddies, DOS Viruses, Downloaders, Email-Worms, Bot-Nets, Jokes, Pirated Cracks (ex: vegas pro crack 2024 that comes with tons of optional offers,) Toolbars, Trojans, and Viewer Made Malware (your own malware!) are some examples of types you can include. If its a file with a password, you must include the password, and if you made it and you want me to add it to the Viewer-Made-Malware folder, then you can say so. An optional thing is specifying the operating systems the malware works on. 

The following is an example of a good issue about contributing.

Malware Submission

Hello LJ9859! I have a malware submission that I would like you to review and possibly upload to your Database. The link is https://www.github.com/lil_timmy/mal-samps/rogues/Windows-8-Antivirus-2022 .  The password is 1234 and it isnt my malware so dont put it in the viewer made malware folder. It works on Windows 8, and 10. Thank you!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Can I fork/pull your repository?

A: No not currently.

Q: Do we have to ask before we use your samples that you made in the "My-Viruses" folder?

A: It would be kind, and I would like to see what you do with it if you upload it somewhere. So yeah if you are using it for a YouTube video or something, atleast notify me about you wanting to use my batch scripts that I made. Ask from the Issues tab.
