# Malware-Database
Malware Database that I put malware into. NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES!
Any work outside of the "My-Viruses" folder belongs to their original owner. Inside the "My-Viruses" Everything DOES belong to a license. 
Again, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, AND YOU SHOULD RUN THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK. ALWAYS USE A VIRTUAL MACHINE FIRST. Even if they dont seem harmful, they can be. Always Use a Virtual Machine.
These are only Windows samples as of the moment, and not Mac or Linux samples. These samples are only for YOUR virtual machine, and you should not by any circumstance use these to "prank" your friends. "Pranking" your friends by downloading these samples and using them to harm your friend's and/or their devices is AGAINST THE LAW and can land you a HEFTY SENTENCE IN COURT.
Again, do not by any means use these outside of a virtual machine whether its by accident or not.

Virtual Machines you can use:

VMWare (I use),
Virtualbox (I use),
Hypervisor,
Any.Run (website),
Parallels,
and Microsoft Azure

The password for all zip files is "1337" without the quotation marks. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Tip: If your running ransomware, NEVER USE SHARED FOLDERS!
All viruses belong to their original owners.
I feel like most people don't like malware only because it could harm their computer, but I view it a different way.
Malware isnt always bad, as long as you know what your doing, have the correct programs, and take proper precautions, malware can be fun to experiment with!
