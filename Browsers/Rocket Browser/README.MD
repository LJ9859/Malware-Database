Rocket Browser, from one of Vinesauce Joel's streams.

IMPORTANT: When you extract, follow this guide. (for Windows Explorer unzipping, or WinZip, or any other archive program, go find a different guide.)

#WinRAR

1. You need to download WinRAR (For this example)

2. Ensure both Rocket Browser Files are in the same folder

3. Select both of them

4. Right click on the selection

5. In the dropdown box, Go to WinRAR > Extract Here (or you can extract to a folder)

6. It will ask you for a password. Enter the one mentioned in this malware database's README.MD .

7. It will say the archive is corrupted. Ignore this box, as it is not corrupted, and just close out of it.

8. You should have a 30MB Rocket Browser Setup File! :D

2. Put both Rocket Browser files in the same place, doesnt have to be a folder
