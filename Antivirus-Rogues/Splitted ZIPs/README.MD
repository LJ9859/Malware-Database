IMPORTANT: When you extract, follow this guide. (for Windows Explorer unzipping, or WinZip, or any other archive program, go find a different guide.)

You need to download WinRAR (For this example)

1. Ensure both the files are in the same folder

2. Select them

3. Right click on the selection

4. In the dropdown box, Go to WinRAR > Extract Here (or you can extract to a folder)

5. It will ask you for a password. Enter the one mentioned in this malware database's README.MD .

6. It will say the archive is corrupted. Ignore this box, as it is not corrupted, and just close out of it.

7. You should have a Setup File! :D
