97% of the time its just ordinary malware, but with the following:
-INTENSE CGI
-No brand name
-Capability to wipe the whole computer
-Things that could be scary to someone that doesnt know what they're doing (ex. MEMZ opening random programs and websites)
Though that other 3% percent of the time, its the same thing but missing atleast one things from that list.
